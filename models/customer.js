//PART 2
//Create method for saving reervations


//PART 3
//Add a quick search form to the bootstrap navigation bar to search for a customer by name.
//You can either make a new route and template to show results, or you could probably make it work with the existing listing index route and template (as youâ€™d prefer).

//PART 4
//Add a new route that finds our top 10 customers ordered by most reservations.
